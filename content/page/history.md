Mirta's Coffee House in Tampa. Over 700 CDs were given away at these highly
successful events.


<a name="history-2005-09-10"></a>
## 10 September 2005

Software Freedom Day was celebrated at both MOSI (Museum of Science and
Industry) in Tampa, and Books A Million in Bradenton. SLUG members organized
these events on their own and gave out quite a few Linux CDs.

## 12 October 2004

Mario Lombardo volunteers to lead the Tampa meetings, currently held at
Hillsborough Community College, taking over for Paul Foster.

## 17 - 18 December 2003

Bill Preece and his helpers again pull off a great tech show, this time the
Biz2Expo at the Tampa Convention Center.


<a name="history-2003-11"></a>
## November 2003

Due to lingering site outages, the SLUG website is moved to an alternate local
hosting service, Networked Knowledge Systems (NKS).


<a name="history-2003-01-05"></a>
## 5 January 2003

Two members of SLUG, not content with the policies of SLUG and their treatment
by SLUG members, start their own LUG as an *alternative* to SLUG: [FLALUG][].


<a name="history-2002-11"></a>
## November 2002

A SLUG member (Aaron Steimle) finally starts up a St Petersburg meeting.


<a name="history-2001-10-17-18"></a>
## 17 - 18 October 2001

Our third CTS Expo, held at the Tampa Convention Center. This was barely a month
after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, so attendance was off and
several exhibitors had backed out of the show. We hosted the Melbourne LUG and
IDEAL Corporation in our booth.


<a name="history-2001-08-10"></a>
## 10 August 2001

Linux Tenth Anniversary Picnic takes place at Lowry Park in Tampa.


<a name="history-2001-05"></a>
## May 2001

SLUG participates in its second [CTS Expo][cts-expo], with a 20'x40' booth and
"Linux Pavilion", this time at the Harborview in Clearwater. This coincided with
the launch of Microsoft's Office XP, and as before, we were the busiest booth at
the show. John "Maddog" Hall was a featured speaker, and we had a couple of run-
ins with Microsoft people.

For a more complete rundown, check out the [CTS Expo][cts-expo].

Sarasota meetings are started.


<a name="history-2001-04"></a>
## April 2001

A four day list outage occurs on the Owl River Company list host. After a local
company-- Networked Knowledge Systems (NKS)-- offers to host the lists, they are
moved to NKS hosts. The SLUG website continues to reside on an Owl River Company
host.

<a name="history-2001-03"></a>
## March 2001

Bylaws are amended and "splinter groups" are eliminated. Instead, leaders of
meetings other than Tampa and Dunedin meetings become officers of the group.
They get a full vote on group matters, and their meetings are announced in the
same way Tampa and Dunedin meetings are announced.

Q & A sessions at Tampa and Dunedin meetings are discontinued, as they quickly
go out of control and degrade into group discussions.


<a name="history-2000-09"></a>
## September 2000

SLUG is asked to man a booth at the Computer and Technology Showcase at the
Tampa Convention Center on the 27th and 28th. Thanks to the efforts of Bill
Preece, Diana Lenko, Norb Cartagena, Tim Jones, Curt Johnson, Ed Centanni and
others, the show is a TREMENDOUS success! Thousands of Linux distros are
acquired and passed out. Speakers from Red Hat, Turbo Linux, Andover and others
make presentations. This is a sharp contrast to the ITEC show in May of 1999.

SLUG has over 400 members.


<a name="history-2000-08"></a>
## August 2000

After one too many flamefests, the SLUG Politics list is inaugurated. The
purpose of the list is to defuse sensitive threads and provide an outlet for the
more politically active SLUG members.


<a name="history-2000-03"></a>
## March 2000

SLUG moves its website and domain name to one of Owl River Company's hosts.
These are the same people who have hosted the lists for almost a year.


<a name="history-2000-01"></a>
## January 2000

SLUG survives the Y2K bug (along with everyone else) and acquires a separate
List Admin, a new Event Coordinator, and an Expansion Director (Marketing/PR
person). Q & A sessions at every meeting are instituted, and presentations are
scheduled for most meetings. Paul Braman opts out as Event/Meeting Coordinator.


<a name="history-1999-08"></a>
## August 1999

SLUG acquires its own domain name: [SuncoastLUG.org][suncoastlug]! Thanks to
Mark Bishop (a SLUG member in absentia) for doing the registration, and Terry
Mackintosh for hosting the domain.

Paul Foster and Ed Centanni presented a demonstration of Linux for the Greater
Tampa Bay PC Users Group. The presentation was well received, and they were
invited back.

SLUG welcomes its three hundredth member!


<a name="history-1999-07-24"></a>
## 24 July 1999

Our first big-name presenter appears! [Stuart Anderson][stuart-anderson] of
Metro Link gave a talk about the Linux Standard Base project.


<a name="history-1999-05"></a>
## May 1999

An online dispute between some members and the list sponsor/admin causes the
list to go dark one Sunday afternoon. After three days of frantic effort, Russ
Herrold of the Central Ohio Linux Users Group (COLUG) volunteers to host the
SLUG list. The SLUG Announce list is also inaugurated.

Thanks to the sponsorship of the Tampa Bay Computer Society, SLUG is invited to
participate in the ITEC show at the Tampa Convention Center. But we're invited
too late, and end up with a auditorium under the stairwell, not a booth on the
show floor. Traffic is dismal, and overall the effort is wasted.


<a name="history-1999-02"></a>
## February 1999

SLUG welcomes its 200th member!


<a name="history-1999-01"></a>
## January 1999

SLUG became a GLUE (Groups of Linux Users Everywhere) member, and received a
"care package" of goodies from SSC (publishers of Linux Journal and sponsors of
GLUE). We also had our first outside presenter, and created the SLUG Lending
Library for users to borrow distributions and software between meetings.


<a name="history-1998-12"></a>
## December 1998

Henry White, long wishing to pass on the leadership of SLUG to someone else,
presided over elections for new officers. Paul M. Foster was elected President,
and Paul Braman (our longtime meeting organizer) was elected Vice President for
Meetings. The "election" was the quickest in history. "Foster wants to do this
and Braman wants to do that. Any objections? Done!"


<a name="history-1998-05"></a>
## May 1998

In May of 1998, Bob Kindle negotiated with the Dunedin Public Library to allow
us to hold Saturday meetings there. The first was held on the 23rd of May 1998
(Memorial Day weekend). Four SLUGs attended due to the holiday and under-
promotion. But since then the number at the Dunedin meetings has been similar to
that in Tampa.


<a name="history-1997-12"></a>
## December 1997

Martin Randal organized a stable meeting place and site for installfests at
Thomas Jefferson High School in Tampa on the second Wednesday of each month. We
held our first installfest at TJHS on 10 December 1997.

By the end of the 1997, SLUG had 66 members!


<a name="history-1997-10"></a>
## October 1997

In October of 1997, based on Ed Centanni's suggestion, Paul Foster organized the
first SLUG meeting at Chili's in Clearwater. It was a rainy day in late October,
the day of the first ever USF homecoming game. Thirteen people showed up. It was
noisy and informal, but it was a start.

Soon thereafter, Martin Randal joined the group and offered his services as
listmaster; now SLUG had a mailing list!


<a name="history-1997-08"></a>
## August 1997

In August 1997, Henry White, Paul Foster, Ed Centanni and a few others were
looking for a local Linux group in the Tampa Bay area. Paul put his name up on
the GLUE (Groups of Linux Users Everywhere) site, volunteering to start a group
if none could be found. Henry sent emails to Paul and just about everyone else
he could find about the possibility of starting/finding a group. Thirty-five
emails were sent out. Eleven were undeliverable, and seven did not reply. The
rest were interested!

Henry volunteered to lead the group. Paul suggested the SLUG name, had his wife
come up with a logo, and provided server space for a SLUG website. Henry soon
"liberated" a lot of web content from the North Texas Linux Users Group (NTLUG),
and this was integrated into the website.

By the end of August 1997, SLUG had twenty members and a full-featured website.
